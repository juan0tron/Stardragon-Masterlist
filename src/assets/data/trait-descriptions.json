These gems can be cut, following the same universal gem cutting rarities (Common: simple shapes, smooth or faceted. Uncommon: encraved and multigem. Rare: Complex cuts, cuts that don't resemble one simple, unified shape.). Arctic Shooters tend to grow tufts on the very ends of their ears, some even folding naturally to protect their gems. Flared ears are uncommonly seen, as they are reminiscent of the Starshooters more 'primitive' Stardragon kin. The flares are divots in the skin itself, not to be confused with fluff or fur.",

It takes about two seasons for a Weaver's fur to accommodate for their climate. Which means yes, they do shed."

These Stardragons emanate great power visibly from their forearms.",

Acting similarly to a rubbery plastic, they are surprisingly soft and flexible, but will become fragile or brittle when engraved. Therefore engraved tailplates are an UNCOMMON trait. Joined plates are plates that grow as one solid connected plate rather than the common four plate arrangement. Uncommon secondary plates float close to the tailplates and generally compliment the shape. It is rare to find Shooters with a tertiary floating plate, or really any number over 2."

The most common arrangements are 5-6 large shards with an equal number of complimenting small shards. Most Shooter's shards grow in rough cut teardrop gem shapes, but variations and cosmetically shaped shards are not unheard of. Uncommon shards are made up of a continuous joined shape, usually in a thin pipe or ring with accompanying floating shards. Shooters with these rings are born with the shape, it cannot be fabricated cosmetically."
